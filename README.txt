               Welcome to Plextastic

You're probably reading this because you didn't trust the
AppleScript "Autoinstall for Mac OS X" that I provided
you with. Probably a good choice, my first AppleScript.

To install, drop the Plextastic directory in the Plex web
server directory which you probably can find here:

 /Applications/Plex.app/Contents/Resources/Plex/web/

If you're using XBMC Media Center you can probably figure
out what path that translates to on your own.

After having started Plex/XBMC you can now visit:

 http://<ip to Plex host>:3000/Plextastic/

To add the application to the home screen, press the plus sign on
your iPad or iPhone, for Android users you can probably figure
something out.

Oh, and 'default.asp' is just what Plex loads by default instead
of 'index.html' like the rest of the world, so you don't have to
type an extra file name after the path on that crappy OSD keyboard
of yours.
