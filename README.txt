You're probably reading this because you didn't trust the AppleScript
"Autoinstall for Mac OS X" that I provided you with. Probably a good
choice, my first, and hopefully last AppleScript.

To install, drop the Plextastic directory in the Plex web server
directory a little something like this:

 /Applications/Plex.app/Contents/Resources/Plex/web/plextastic

If you're using XBMC Media Center you can probably figure out what
path that translates to on your own. I cannot guarantee it'll work
as I only use Plex myself, please report any problems.

After having started Plex/XBMC you can now visit:

 http://<ip to Plex host>:3000/plextastic/

To add the application to the home screen, press the plus sign on
your iPad or iPhone, for Android users you can probably figure
something out.

Oh, and 'default.asp' is just what Plex loads by default instead
of 'index.html' like the rest of the world, so you don't have to
type an extra file name after the path on that crappy OSD keyboard
of yours.

                          enjoy!

PS. I like criticism if it comes with patches.
