               Welcome to Plextastic
             - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

To install, drop the Plextastic directory in the Plex web
server directory which you probably can find here:

 /Applications/Plex.app/Contents/Resources/Plex/web/

You can now point your browser to:

 http://<ip to Plex host>:3000/Plextastic/

To add the application to the home screen, press the plus sign on
your iPad or iPhone, for Android users you can probably figure
something out.

Oh, and 'default.asp' is just what Plex loads by default instead
of 'index.html' like the rest of the world.
